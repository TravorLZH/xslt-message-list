XSLT Message List
=======

This is my demonstration of XML with XSLT. As you open an XML file in a browser, it shows you beautiful html5 content instead of code.

> IE does not support aside, so the layout in IE is pretty ugly

## Why not XSLT & XML

XSLT helps more 3rd party software access our public data in XML format instead of using more complicated algorithms to fetch data.

## Advantages

Data and layout are separated into two. So we won't mess up the layout when we're modifying data that it will be more convenient for users.
